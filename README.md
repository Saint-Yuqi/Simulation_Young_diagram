My current project involves an in-depth examination of the stochastic characteristics inherent in the expansion of random Young diagrams. By integrating sophisticated statistical methodologies with computational programming techniques, I am meticulously evaluating various conjectures associated with the probabilistic progression of these diagrams. This study aims to uncover underlying patterns and behaviors that emerge during the random growth process of Young diagrams.
